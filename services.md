                    <p>Based on the latest <a href="https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/2020-phishing-and-fraud-report" target=_blank>report from F5</a>, phishing attacks account for the top cyber threat pretty much in every country. These type of attacks are so successfull because they exploit a skill often overlook by most businesses: trust. With a culture of transparency, honesty and integrity a company can build trust which translates in the employees doing the right thing when it comes down to protect what is most important to every company: its data.</p>
