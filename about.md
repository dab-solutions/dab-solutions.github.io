            <p>dab Solutions was born as a consultancy firm in 2020 to help customers boost their journey into securing their businesses.</p>
            <p>Operating in a cloud and remote first environment presents unique security challenges: data is often dispersed across multiple locations and devices, making it more difficult to secure and manage; remote workforces can introduce new vulnerabilities if proper security protocols and controls are not in place; security technologies and processes have hard time to adapt to environments where the trust boundaries are non-traditional and ever-changing.</p>
            <p>With the thriving ecosystem of technologies around, each company is growing more unique in its technology stack and therefore security must take a new approach to solve these challenges.</p>
            <p>In addition to our security services, we also offer DevOps services to help our clients streamline their development and operations processes, and by integrating security into the DevOps workflow, we can help our clients build and maintain reliable, secure systems more efficiently.</p>
            <p>Our services are designed to help our clients stay ahead of these challenges and ensure that their systems and data are secure from external and internal threats. We offer a range of services to help our clients identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities and manage risk.</p>
            <p>We pride ourselves on our ability to deliver high-quality solutions to our clients, no matter how big or small their organization may be. We have years of expertise in build tools for cloud-first startups aiming at securing the company's most critical assets at scale in a fast-changing context, and our team is dedicated to helping our clients achieve their security goals and protect their businesses from the potential risks that come with operating in the digital world.</p>
