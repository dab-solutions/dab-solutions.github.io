            <p>Fast and avid learner, passionate, security is not a 9 to 5 job: it’s a mindset who needs proactive thinking and change of prospective between attacker and defender. This attitude allowed me to meet and exceed managers' expectations, making an impact in every team I had the pleasure and honor to work with.</p>

            <p>Since I was 14, when I approached cybersecurity for the first time, I never stopped learning: from an offensive mindset to a blue team one, going through incident response, I find myself at ease with most aspect of security, including policies and procedures.</p>

            <p>In today’s companies, where workforce is composed by people from all over the world and different walk of life, communication and interpersonal skills are key for personal, team and business success. I am constantly studying how to improve my emotional intelligence in order to have a positive impact not only from a technical prospective but also from an human point of view: creating bonds is the best way to move forward unite in the same direction.</p>

            <p>Quote that speaks to me the most: Nothing great in the world was accomplished without passion. (cit. Friedrich Hegel).</p>
